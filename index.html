The Gymrek Lab is located at the University of California San Diego. We are part of the Department of Medicine's Division of Genetics and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. We are also a member of the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology program</a> at UCSD.

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
Our overall goal is to understand complex genetic variants that underlie human disease. We are particularly interested in repetitive DNA variants known as short tandem repeats (STRs) as a model for complex variation. Our work will focus on developing computational tools for analyzing and visualizing complex variation from large-scale sequencing data and applying these tools to learn about the contribution of repetitive variation to human disease. See the <a href="research.html">research page</a> to learn more!
