* "GangSTR: Genome-wide genotyping of short tandem repeat expansions." **Nima Mouavi**, Sharona Shleizer-Burko, and Melissa Gymrek. Thursday 10/18 11:45-12:00, Ballroom 20A (#188) [GangSTR preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/03/361162)

## Posters
* "A reference haplotype panel for genome-wide imputation of short tandem repeat variants." **Shubham Saini**, Ileena Mitra, Nima Mouavi, Stephanie F. Fotsing, Melissa Gymrek. Thursday 10/18 3-4pm (#1546) [SNP-STR panel preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/24/277673)
