We just published a paper[1] on our efforts to figure out which 
[Short Tandem Repeats (STRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite)
can be strongly associated with gene expression levels. You can find
the paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0521-9). (You can also 
see a less edited but free version [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/495226v2) if you do not have access to the Nature 
Genetics journal).

Due to length constraints, we had to cut many explanatory sentences from the final paper. However, I''d like
anyone who wants to be able to read the paper, even if they have only basic background in genetics
and statistics. So I''ve written a [glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-UzcQiRFtoJvObUIP8cPyHO3E1gkQG3DmlmgnEp1y8/edit)
for those readers - whenever you come across a term or acronym that''s new to you, or a topic you don''t quite understand,
feel free to look it up there.
